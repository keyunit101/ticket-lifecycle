# ticket-lifecycle

<p>So in this lab, I'm going to use osTicket as an end user and create some tickets. Then, I'm going to receive the tickets as a helpdesk employee and resolve them. Todd Odd is creating a ticket claiming that customers are receiving a 404 error when browsing online banking.</p>

<p>This is the Agents panel where Agents can see live tickets. Queue managers will assign priority tickets to the appropriate agents, as well as assigning proper SLAs.</p>

<p>As you can see, Todd Odd's ticket is set to an emergency because it is a business-critical function, and the SLA is set to a SEV-A, which is high priority and needs to be handled within two hours. The ticket was also assigned to Agent Keyon Alexander to handle.</p>

<p>Agent Keyon Alexander responds to Todd's ticket and lets him know that coordination between the Sys Admin is being taken care of in order to get online banking back online.</p>
